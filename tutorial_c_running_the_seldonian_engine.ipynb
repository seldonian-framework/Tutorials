        "The Seldonian Engine library is one of the components of the Seldonian Toolkit. The engine is the core library that implements a basic Seldonian algorithm. The Experiments library is another component of the toolkit that runs many trials of a Seldonian algorithm. In doing so, it calls the engine many times. Because the Experiments library is dependent on the Engine library, but not vice versa, we present the Engine first in these tutorials. However, once you are more familiar with these libraries and Seldonian algorithms in general, you will find that the typical workflow involves first running Seldonian Experiments with the Experiments library. Once a Seldonian model is vetted with the Experiments library, then one can run the engine a single time to obtain a safe or fair model. The process can be thought of analogously to the development/deployment process. The Experiments library is used for development, and when it is time to deploy the model, the Engine library is used.\n"

        "Consider a simple supervised regression problem with two continuous random variables $X$ and $Y$. Let the goal be to predict the label $Y$ using the single feature $X$. One approach to this problem is to use gradient descent on a linear regression model with the mean squared error (MSE) as the objective function. Recall that the mean squared error of predictions $\\hat Y$ is the expected squared difference between the actual value of $Y$ and the prediction $\\hat Y$, i.e., $\\mathbf{E}[(Y-\\hat Y)^2]$. We can approximate an optimal solution by minimizing the objective function with respect to the weights of the model, $\\theta$, which in this case are just the intercept and slope of the line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's suppose we want to add the following two constraints into the problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Ensure that the MSE is less than or equal to $2.0$ with a probability of at least $0.9$. \n",
        "2. Ensure that the MSE is <i>greater than or equal to</i> $1.25$ with a probability of at least $0.9$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice that this second constraint conflicts with the primary objective of minimizing the MSE. Though this particular constraint is contrived, it models the common setting of interest wherein safety and fairness constraints conflict with the primary objective.\n",
        "\n",
        "This problem can now be fully formulated as a Seldonian machine learning problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "Minimize the MSE, subject to the constraints:\n",
        "\n",
        "*  $g_{1}: \\mathrm{Mean\\_Squared\\_Error} \\leq 2.0$, and ${\\delta}_1=0.1$.  \n",
        "*  $g_{2}: \\mathrm{Mean\\_Squared\\_Error} \\geq 1.25$, and ${\\delta}_2=0.1$.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, notice that the values of ${\\delta}_1$ and ${\\delta}_2$ are both $0.1$. This is because constraints are enforced with a probability of at least $1-{\\delta}$, and we stated that the constraints should be enforced with a probability of at least $0.9$. The Seldonian algorithm will attempt to satisfy both of these constraints simultaneously, while also minimizing the primary objective, the MSE. If it cannot find a solution that satisfies the constraints at the confidence levels provided, it will return \"NSF\", i.e., \"No Solution Found\". \n",
        "\n",
        "Next, notice that here the MSE is <i>not</i> just the average squared error on the available training data. These constraints are much stronger: they are constraints on the MSE when the learned model is applied to <i>new data</i>. This is important because we don't just want machine learning models that appear to be safe or fair on the training data. We want machine learning models that are safe or fair when used to made decisions or predictions in the future.\n",

They are written in the form: $g_i \\leq 0$, where $g_i$ here represents the $i$th constraint function. For example, $1.25-(\\text{Mean_Squared_Error})\\leq0$ is mathematically equivalent to $\\text{Mean_Squared_Error} \\geq 1.25$, the form we used to specify our second constraint at the beginning of the tutorial. This rearrangement is done for consistency in interpreting the upper bounds\n",
