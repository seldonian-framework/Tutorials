            <hr>
            Dr. Hoag is the primary software engineer behind this library. Before working for BERI, he worked as a software developer at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute at Princeton University, where he developed tools for brain-wide visualization and analysis. He received his PhD in Physics from UC Davis in 2018 and conducted postdoctoral research in astrophysics at UCLA.

            Prof. Thomas initiated the creation of this library, and continues to supervise and contribute to its development. His research focuses on ensuring the safety of artificial intelligence systems, with emphases on ensuring the safety and fairness of machine learning algorithms and on creating safe and practical reinforcement learning algorithms. He is the co-director of the <a href="https://all.cs.umass.edu/">Autonomous Learning Lab (ALL)</a> at the University of Massachusetts.
